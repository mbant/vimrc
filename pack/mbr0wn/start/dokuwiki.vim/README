This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2374

A simple syntax file for DokuWiki.

This consists completely of slight modifications to wikipedia.vim, vimscript #1787, so you'll need to get
that script too, or not much will happen.

I'm no expert, so do let me know if you find any mistakes. My email is in both files. Thanks. :)

This file also provides a few mappings for doing those pesky headers.

,,h1 through ,,h6 will give you a header. This should allow you to press ",,h1" in INSERT mode, then type your header, then press <C-j> to 
jump to the next line. 

(If <C-j> doesn't jump for you, let me know; this may require latex-suite
(http://vim-latex.sf.net), but that would be a hefty thing to download just for this.)

You can also use ,,hd to demote a header, and ,,hp to promote it.
